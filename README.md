# 3D Model Presenting in Android
> This is a sample android app to present your 3D models with .glb or .glTF extensions with 2 easy ways.

Aim of this project is to teach how to use and present 3D models in an android app. The main, and suggested way to that is using model viewer which is also used
as the name of the project. However, there is still a good solution which is using ARCore, and it's implementation is also included in this project.

## Documentation
1 - Model-Viewer: Model-Viewer is a web based solution where we simply load a html code into a web view. Model-viewer's own documantation is a great
source to find out what you can do more. Especially check out the attributes you can give to a model, and how it will create what you are looking 
for. Link -> [model-viewer][model-viewer]

2 - ARCore: ARCore which is also known as Google Play Services for AR Link is developed by Google and used to create augmented reality applications. Even
though augmented reality is not used in this project, you can still use ARCore for simply presenting your 3D models. Though, in case you need to present
your models in an augmented reality ARCore allows you to do so which makes it a more suitable solution than using model-viewer in that case Link -> [ARCore][ARCore]

## Tutorial Video
There is also a very short tutorial video for this project in which implementations are explained, and differences between those 2 solutions are simply mentioned.
So in case of any kind of need to understand the project, just go and check out the video and leave a comment if you still have something unclear in your mind.
